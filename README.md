Hi, I'm **Bian**, a future data scientist or AI/ML engineer passionate about creating comprehensive models to solve real-world problems. I have a strong background in data analysis, mathematics, and machine learning. I believe that data is a key component to uncover solutions to all complex problems.

## Education
#### Bachelor of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia *(2021 - present)*
- Current GPA: 3.81

## Experiences
### Data Engineering Intern at Telkomsel *(Feb 2024 - Jun 2024)*
As a part of MSIB 6 program, I was placed in Network Performance Analysis & Consolidation (NPAC) team together with 2 other data science interns. During my internship, I had the opportunity to contribute in constructing various datasets as well as creating several machine learning models.

**Key Contributions:**
- Utilized techniques such as web scraping, GeoTIFF image extraction, and complex joins to create comprehensive datasets
- Developed machine learning models for hundreds of time-series datasets simultaneously, as well as for tabular datasets, to predict revenue accurately
- Created a clustering model to score regions based on their revenue generation potential

### Teaching Assistant at Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia *(Jul 2022 - Jun 2024)*
- Courses: **Discrete Math 1 & 2, Numerical Analysis, and Statistics & Probability**
- Proposed problems and solutions for homework assignments
- Graded quizzes & assignments and gave feedback to ~20 students in each subject
- Conducted tutorials to assist students in understanding the material, especially in preparation for mid-term and final exams

## Projects
### [Predictive Modelling and Clustering Analysis on Flight Delay Dataset](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vx9ig2Q5tajqt38xUwrdUb2babydKOegN6yKC3Rxxxk/edit#slide=id.g264ada56e4b_1_860)
As a final project for AI & Data Science course at Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia, my group conducted thorough exploratory data analyses (EDAs) to provide insights, developed machine learning models to predict delay reason and total taxi time for each flight, and performed clustering analysis to reveal hidden patterns and relationships in this dataset. For machine learning models, we tried to use several models to see which model is best suited for the given task. Unfortunately, there is one mistake that we did when choosing the models. Predicting delay reason is a multiclass classification task. But, one of the models that we used is Logistic Regression, which is a binary classification model. Funnily enough, we just noticed it when we were told by one of the assessor lecturers during our presentation about it.

### [Eschikon Wheat Segmentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF3hW2Rk0w/5unENP5oTMYhuT-9mwCrIw/edit)
As a final project for Image Processing course at Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia, my group developed an image segmentation method for eschikon wheat using both conventional and machine learning methods. For conventional methods, we tried several color index-based methods before using Otsu Thresholding to get the segmentation results. For machine learning methods, we tried several deep learning methods, such as CNN and U-Net.

### [Magidox Search Engine](http://magidox.christophernw.com/) (inactive)
As a final project for Information Retrieval course at Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia, my group made Magidox, a search engine made from scratch. This search engine incorporates document indexing for efficient retrieval, data compression, and document ranking.

### [Spoiler Detection in Movie Reviews](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1f4LGuW_rk4fs-1jvyRwyPtH6lsFoNdT6?usp=sharing)
For a little side project, I am trying to develop a system to detect whether there are spoilers or not in movie reviews. Currently experimenting with TF-IDF and BERT with ~66% accuracy at max.

## Awards and Achievements
### Bronze Medal of National Science Olympiad in Mathematics (OSN Matematika) - Ministry of Education Indonesia (2019)
Ranked 16 out of 77 national participants, successfully screened from over 10.000 participants from all over Indonesia
